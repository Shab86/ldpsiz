ldpsiz
======

This repository has been moved to githup.com:alanrogers/pophist.git,
because it is no longer just about linkage disequilibrium (LD). It now
used the site frequency spectrum as well as LD. I'm leaving the "ldpsiz"
version intact, however, because the url is listed in one published paper. 

Ldpsiz is a computer package that estimates the history of population
size from data on linkage disequilibrium (LD).
