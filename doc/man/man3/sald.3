`sald`: use simplex-simulated annealing to estimate population history ======================================================================
.PP
To estimate the parameters describing population history, we need to find values that provide the best fit to data, which include both linkage disequilibrium (measured by $\sigma_d^2$) and the site frequency spectrum\&. This involves maximization on a complex surface with lots of local peaks\&. (To verify this for yourself, see \fBmcmcld\fP\&.) To avoid getting stuck on local peaks, `sald` uses the simplex version of simulated annealing\&.
.PP
Usage -----
.PP
The input data file should be as produced by \fBeld\fP\&.
.PP
Although simulated annealing works pretty well, I often find that different runs end up on different peaks\&. Therefore, `sald` is able to launch multiple simulated annealing jobs, each from a random starting point\&. These can run in parallel, on separate threads\&. The number of parallel optimizers is set using the `--nOpt` argument described below\&.
.PP
The program also deals with bootstrap data, as provided by \fBeld\fP\&. The various boostrap data sets also run in parallel if your machine has multiple cores\&. By default `sald` does not process bootstrap replicates: use `--bootfile` if you want it to\&.
.PP
By default `sald` uses as many threads as your machine has cores\&. This is not a good idea if you are sharing a machine with other users\&. Set the number of threads to some smaller number using `--threads`\&. On linux or osx, you can use `top` to figure out how many threads are actually running\&. If you launch 20 threads but only 10 run at any given time, your job will run slower\&. Stop it and launch again with `--threads 10`\&.
.PP
Simulated annealing works by beginning with a flattened version of the objective function\&. In this flattened version, all the peaks are smaller, so it is easy for the simplex to move from peak to peak\&. The extent of flattening is controlled by a parameter called 'temperature'\&. High temperature implies lots of flattening\&. The annealing algorithm runs for awhile at a high temperature, then lowers the temperature and runs awhile more\&. The succession of temperatures and the number of iterations at each temperature is called the 'annealing schedule'\&. You can change the performance of the algorithm by adjusting this schedule\&. See the `--initTmptr`, `--nPerTmptr` and `--tmptrDecay` arguments\&.
.PP
If a bootstrap file is specified using the -f or --bootfile option, `sald` will also write a file containing the parameter estimates for each bootstrap replicate\&. This file has a name like <input_file_name>-<jobid>\&.fboot, where <input_file_name> is the base name of the input file, and <jobid> is a hexadecimal number intended to uniquely identify the current job\&. This \&.fboot file can be used as input to the program `tabfboot`\&.
