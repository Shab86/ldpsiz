.SH NAME
ms2gtp \- This file contains code related ms2gtp, a program that translates output from Dick Hudson's \fCms\fP program into \&.gtp format\&.
.PP
.SH "ms2gtp, a program that converts \fCms\fP output into \&.gtp format "
.PP
.PP
This program is written in C, because the conversion involves transposing a large matrix, and this is faster in C\&. If you run it like 'ms2gtp my_input_file_name', it will allocate internal arrays using default values\&. If your \fCms\fP output is large, these arrays will be too small\&. The program will print an error message and abort\&. To avoid this problem, run the (unix or linux) command 'grep positions
ms\&.out | wc'\&. This will print 3 numbers\&. The number of tokens must be as large as 2nd; buffer size as large as the 3rd\&. You can set these values using the \fC--maxTokens\fP and \fC--inBuffSize\fP arguments\&.
.PP
For example, I used \fCms\fP to produce a file called \fCms\&.out\fP\&. To find out how large to set the arrays, I executed 
.PP
.nf
grep positions ms.out | wc 

.fi
.PP
.PP
which produced the output 
.PP
.nf
1   89366 1161757

.fi
.PP
.PP
This indicates that I need to accomodate input lines with 89366 tokens and 1161757 characters\&. So I ran \fCms2gtp\fP like this: 
.PP
.nf
ms2gtp --maxTokens 89370 --inBuffSize 1161800 ms.out > ms.gtp

.fi
.PP
.PP
This reads input from file \fCms\&.out\fP and writes to file \fCms\&.gtp\fP\&. The first few lines of \fCms\&.gtp\fP look like this: 
.PP
.nf
# ms2gtp was run Sat Feb  2 11:15:05 2013
# cmd line     = ms2gtp -t 89370 -b 1161800 ms.out
# sim cmd      = ms 50 1 -t 20000 -r 20000 1000000
# nnucleotides = 1000000
# segsites     = 89365
# nsequences   = 50
# recomb rate per site = 1e-06
# ploidy       = 1
#   snp_id     nucpos         mappos alleles genotypes
         0          1 0.000000006802      01 0011000000...
         1          6 0.000000061255      01 0000000000...

In this example, I've truncated the genotypes on the right in order to fit them on the page\&.

Here is the usage message: 
.PP
.nf
usage: ms2gtp [options] [input_file_name]
   where options may include:
   -t \<x\> or --maxTokens \<x\>
      maximum tokens per input line
   -b \<x\> or --inBuffSize \<x\>
      size of input buffer
   -R \<x\> or --recombination \<x\>
      rate for adjacent nucleotides
   -h     or --help
      print this message
  To figure out appropriate values for -t and -b, execute the
  following at the command line:

     grep positions ms.out | wc

  where "ms.out" is the ms output file. This command prints 3 numbers.
  Number of tokens must be as large as 2nd; buffer size as large as the
  3rd. If no input file is given, ms2gtp reads stdin. ms2gtp
  always writes to standard output.
