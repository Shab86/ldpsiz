eld \- Estimate LD from genetic data\&.
.PP
.SH "\fCeld\fP, a program that estimates LD from genetic data "
.PP
.PP
Parameter values, including those describing population history, may be read either from the initialization file \fCldpsiz\&.ini\fP or specified on the command line\&. Command-line arguments override values in the initialization file\&.
.PP
\fCeld\fP reads data in 'gtp' format and estimates two measures of LD: $\hat\sigma_d^2$ and $r^2$\&. The program compares all pairs of sites within a window that slides across the data set\&. These pairs are tabulated into bins based on the distance (in cM) that separates them\&. For each bin, the program estimates and prints the two measures of LD\&. The maximal separation between pairs of SNPs is determined by the \fC--window\fP (or \fC-w\fP) option\&.
.PP
Optionally, the program calculates a moving-blocks bootstrap for $\hat\sigma_d^2$\&. To turn on this option, use the \fC--bootreps\fP option discussed below\&. The program will then print lower and upper confidence limits along with each estimate of $\hat\sigma_d^2$\&. By default, the bootstrap includes 95% of the sampling distribution distribution\&. This fraction can be modified using the initialization file\&. Optionally, the bootstrap may be stored in a separate file for use by other programs\&. To accomplish this, use the command-line option \fC--bootfile\fP or set \fCbootfile\fP in \fCldpsiz\&.ini\fP\&.
.PP
By default, the program uses as many threads as there are cores on the machine\&. To change this, use the command-line option \fC--threads\fP or set \fCnthreads\fP in the file \fCldpsiz\&.ini\fP\&.

usage: eld [options] input_file_name
   where options may include:
   -b \<x\> or --blocksize \<x\>
      SNPs per bootstrap block
   -f \<x\> or --bootfile \<x\>
      name of bootstrap output file
   -h or --help
      print this message
   -i \<x\> or --interval \<x\>
      for debugging: increase speed by examining every x'th focal SNP
   -n \<x\> or --nbins \<x\>
      tablulate values into x bins
   -r \<x\> or --bootreps \<x\>
      number of bootstrap replicates (def: 0)
   -t \<x\> or --threads \<x\>
      number of threads (default is auto)
   -v     or --verbose
      more output
   -w \<x\> or --window \<x\>
      window size in cM
