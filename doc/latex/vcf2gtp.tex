\-Convert .vcf files into .gtp format.

\hyperlink{vcf2gtp_8py}{vcf2gtp.\-py}, a program that converts .vcf files into .gtp format ===============================================================

usage\-: vcf2gtp \mbox{[}options filename.\-vcf genetic\-Map\-File\mbox{]} where options may include\-:

-\/r $<$x$>$ or -\/-\/recomb\-Per\-B\-P $<$x$>$ \-Set recombination rate per nucleotide.

\-If two filenames are provided, the first must be a vcf file and the second a file of recombination rates. \-In this case, the -\/r option is not allowed.

\-If one filename is provided, it must be a vcf file, and the -\/r option is mandatory.

\-If no filename is provided, the program reads vcf data from standard input and the -\/r option is mandatory.

\-The program writes to standard output.

\-If no file is provided for recombination rates, the rate must be specified using the `-\/r` or `-\/-\/recomb\-Per\-B\-P` option, and the program generates map distances assuming that the recombination rate between two sites is proportional to the number of nucleotides that separate them.

\-The genetic map file must have a format like this\-:

position \-C\-O\-M\-B\-I\-N\-E\-D\-\_\-rate(c\-M/\-Mb) \-Genetic\-\_\-\-Map(c\-M) 14431347 9.\-6640973708 0 14432618 9.\-7078062447 0.\-0122830678 14433624 9.\-7138922111 0.\-0220491208 14433659 9.\-7163435060 0.\-0223891071 14433758 9.\-7078087850 0.\-0233510251

\-The first line is a list of column labels. \-After that, each row corresponds to a \hyperlink{struct_s_n_p}{\-S\-N\-P}. \-The first column gives the position, in nucleotides from the end of the chromosome. \-The second column gives the recombination rate, in c\-M per \-Mb, between that \hyperlink{struct_s_n_p}{\-S\-N\-P} and the next one, and the third column gives the map distance in c\-M. \-This is the format used by the 1000-\/\-Genomes \-Project
