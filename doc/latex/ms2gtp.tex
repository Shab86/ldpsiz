\-This file contains code related ms2gtp, a program that translates output from \-Dick \-Hudson's `ms` program into .gtp format.

ms2gtp, a program that converts `ms` output into .gtp format ============================================================

\-This program is written in \-C, because the conversion involves transposing a large matrix, and this is faster in \-C. \-If you run it like \char`\"{}ms2gtp my\-\_\-input\-\_\-file\-\_\-name\char`\"{}, it will allocate internal arrays using default values. \-If your `ms` output is large, these arrays will be too small. \-The program will print an error message and abort. \-To avoid this problem, run the (unix or linux) command \char`\"{}grep positions
 ms.\-out $|$ wc\char`\"{}. \-This will print 3 numbers. \-The number of tokens must be as large as 2nd; buffer size as large as the 3rd. \-You can set these values using the `-\/-\/max\-Tokens` and `-\/-\/in\-Buff\-Size` arguments.

\-For example, \-I used `ms` to produce a file called `ms.out`. \-To find out how large to set the arrays, \-I executed

grep positions ms.\-out $|$ wc

which produced the output

1 89366 1161757

\-This indicates that \-I need to accomodate input lines with 89366 tokens and 1161757 characters. \-So \-I ran `ms2gtp` like this\-:

ms2gtp -\/-\/max\-Tokens 89370 -\/-\/in\-Buff\-Size 1161800 ms.\-out $>$ ms.\-gtp

\-This reads input from file `ms.out` and writes to file `ms.gtp`. \-The first few lines of `ms.gtp` look like this\-:

\# ms2gtp was run \-Sat \-Feb 2 11\-:15\-:05 2013 \# cmd line = ms2gtp -\/t 89370 -\/b 1161800 ms.\-out \# sim cmd = ms 50 1 -\/t 20000 -\/r 20000 1000000 \# nnucleotides = 1000000 \# segsites = 89365 \# nsequences = 50 \# recomb rate per site = 1e-\/06 \# ploidy = 1 \# snp\-\_\-id nucpos mappos alleles genotypes 0 1 0.\-000000006802 01 0011000000... 1 6 0.\-000000061255 01 0000000000...

\-In this example, \-I've truncated the genotypes on the right in order to fit them on the page.

\-Here is the usage message\-:

usage\-: ms2gtp \mbox{[}options\mbox{]} \mbox{[}input\-\_\-file\-\_\-name\mbox{]} where options may include\-: -\/t $<$x$>$ or -\/-\/max\-Tokens $<$x$>$ maximum tokens per input line -\/b $<$x$>$ or -\/-\/in\-Buff\-Size $<$x$>$ size of input buffer -\/\-R $<$x$>$ or -\/-\/recombination $<$x$>$ rate for adjacent nucleotides -\/h or -\/-\/help print this message \-To figure out appropriate values for -\/t and -\/b, execute the following at the command line\-:

grep positions ms.\-out $|$ wc

where \char`\"{}ms.\-out\char`\"{} is the ms output file. \-This command prints 3 numbers. \-Number of tokens must be as large as 2nd; buffer size as large as the 3rd. \-If no input file is given, ms2gtp reads stdin. ms2gtp always writes to standard output.
