\-Estimate \-L\-D from genetic data.

`eld`, a program that estimates \-L\-D from genetic data ==================================================================

\-Parameter values, including those describing population history, may be read either from the initialization file `ldpsiz.ini` or specified on the command line. \-Command-\/line arguments override values in the initialization file.

`eld` reads data in \char`\"{}gtp\char`\"{} format and estimates two measures of \-L\-D\-: $\hat\sigma_d^2$ and $r^2$. \-The program compares all pairs of sites within a window that slides across the data set. \-These pairs are tabulated into bins based on the distance (in c\-M) that separates them. \-For each bin, the program estimates and prints the two measures of \-L\-D. \-The maximal separation between pairs of \-S\-N\-Ps is determined by the `-\/-\/window` (or `-\/w`) option.

\-Optionally, the program calculates a moving-\/blocks bootstrap for $\hat\sigma_d^2$. \-To turn on this option, use the `-\/-\/bootreps` option discussed below. \-The program will then print lower and upper confidence limits along with each estimate of $\hat\sigma_d^2$. \-By default, the bootstrap includes 95\% of the sampling distribution distribution. \-This fraction can be modified using the initialization file. \-Optionally, the bootstrap may be stored in a separate file for use by other programs. \-To accomplish this, use the command-\/line option `-\/-\/bootfile` or set `bootfile` in `ldpsiz.ini`.

\-By default, the program uses as many threads as there are cores on the machine. \-To change this, use the command-\/line option `-\/-\/threads` or set `nthreads` in the file `ldpsiz.ini`.
