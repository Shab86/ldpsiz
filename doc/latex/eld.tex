Estimate L\+D from genetic data.

\subsection*{{\ttfamily eld}, a program that estimates L\+D from genetic data }

Parameter values, including those describing population history, may be read either from the initialization file {\ttfamily ldpsiz.\+ini} or specified on the command line. Command-\/line arguments override values in the initialization file.

{\ttfamily eld} reads data in \char`\"{}gtp\char`\"{} format and estimates two measures of L\+D\+: $\hat\sigma_d^2$ and $r^2$. The program compares all pairs of sites within a window that slides across the data set. These pairs are tabulated into bins based on the distance (in c\+M) that separates them. For each bin, the program estimates and prints the two measures of L\+D. The maximal separation between pairs of S\+N\+Ps is determined by the {\ttfamily -\/-\/window} (or {\ttfamily -\/w}) option.

Optionally, the program calculates a moving-\/blocks bootstrap for $\hat\sigma_d^2$. To turn on this option, use the {\ttfamily -\/-\/bootreps} option discussed below. The program will then print lower and upper confidence limits along with each estimate of $\hat\sigma_d^2$. By default, the bootstrap includes 95\% of the sampling distribution distribution. This fraction can be modified using the initialization file. Optionally, the bootstrap may be stored in a separate file for use by other programs. To accomplish this, use the command-\/line option {\ttfamily -\/-\/bootfile} or set {\ttfamily bootfile} in {\ttfamily ldpsiz.\+ini}.

By default, the program uses as many threads as there are cores on the machine. To change this, use the command-\/line option {\ttfamily -\/-\/threads} or set {\ttfamily nthreads} in the file {\ttfamily ldpsiz.\+ini}. \begin{DoxyVerb}usage: eld [options] input_file_name
