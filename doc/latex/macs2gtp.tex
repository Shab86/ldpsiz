Parse output of macs, produce gtp format, the input for eld.

\subsection*{\hyperlink{macs2gtp_8py}{macs2gtp.\+py}, a program that converts {\ttfamily macs} output into .gtp format }

\begin{DoxyVerb}Usage: macs2gtp.py [options] \<input file\> 
where options may include:
  -R \<x\> : set recombination rate for adjacent sites
\end{DoxyVerb}


For example, \begin{DoxyVerb}macs2gtp.py -R 1e-8 macs.out > macs.gtp
\end{DoxyVerb}


Would read file {\ttfamily macs.\+out}, generate map distances assuming a recombination rate of 1e-\/8 per nucleotide, and write the output into macs.\+gtp.

If the recombination rate is not specified, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{macs2gtp_8py}{macs2gtp.\+py}} tries to get it from the initialization file {\ttfamily ldpsiz.\+ini}.
